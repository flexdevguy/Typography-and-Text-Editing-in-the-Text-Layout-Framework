	<p>Over the years a huge number of theological manhours have been spent debating the famous question: </p>
	<p><span fontStyle="italic">How Many Angels Can Dance on the Head of a Pin?</span></p> 
	<p>In order to arrive at an answer, the following facts must be taken into consideration:</p>
	<p>Firstly, angels simply don't dance. It's one of the distinguishing characteristics that mark an angel. They may listen appreciatively to the Music of the Spheres, but they don't feel the urge to get down and boogie to it. So, <span fontStyle="italic">none.</span></p>
	<p>At least, nearly none. Aziraphale had learned to gavotte in a discreet gentlemen's club in Portland Place, in the late 1880s, and while he had initially taken to it like a duck to merchant banking, after a while he had become quite good at it, and was quite put out when, some decades later, the gavotte went out of style for good.</p>
	<p>So providing the dance was a gavotte, and providing that he had a suitable partner (also able, for the sake of argument, both to gavotte, and to dance it on the head of a pin), the answer is a straightforward <span fontStyle="italic">one</span>.</p>
